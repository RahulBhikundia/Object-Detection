# **Comparative Analysis of Object Detection Algorithms on BCCD Dataset**

This project involves the implementation and comparison of state-of-the-art object detection algorithms—YOLOv5, YOLOv8, and Detectron2—on the BCCD dataset. The primary objective is to detect and classify red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets from microscopic blood smear images, providing insights into the performance and applicability of these models in medical image analysis.
